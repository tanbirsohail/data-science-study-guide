# Tools
Here I include some of the tools and website for learning and practicing machine learning online

## Google Colab
[Link](https://colab.research.google.com) Google's colaboratory is great. It lets you run models on TPUs and GPUs for free.

## Mybinder.org

[Link](https://mybinder.org) Lets you turn any github repo full of jupyter notebooks into a cloud instance running with all your notebooks available.
If you need pacakages and repos, you can provide requirements.txt and binder will get them for you. You can check out my repo of some basic jupyter notebooks [here](https://github.com/tanbirsohail/jupyter-notebooks).
