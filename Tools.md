# Tools
Here I include some of the tools and website for learning and practicing machine learning and data science online.



## Google Colab

[Link](https://colab.research.google.com) Google's colaboratory is great. It lets you run models on TPUs and GPUs for free.

## Mybinder.org

[Link](https://mybinder.org) Lets you turn any github repo full of jupyter notebooks into a cloud instance running with all your notebooks available.
If you need pacakages and repos, you can provide requirements.txt and binder will get them for you. You can check out my repo of some basic jupyter notebooks [here](https://github.com/tanbirsohail/jupyter-notebooks).

## Tensorflow Playground

[Link](https://playground.tensorflow.org/) Lets you experiement with neural network and visualize activities when neurons fire in a very beautiful toolkit. After you have learnt the basics, you should come and experiment here to solidify your concepts.

## Kaggle

[Link](https://www.kaggle.com/) Yes, this is the heaven for data science. The first place you should have your profile if you are serious about data science. This is the place where you do real world data science and compete with the best data scientists in the world.
