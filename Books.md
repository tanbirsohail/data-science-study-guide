# Books
Here are the books that are a must. Please note that I am not including any links to these books. A simple google search will be good enough to find these because most of them are very popular. I suggest you to take a Kindle Unlimited Subscription or O'Reilly's Safari Books Online Subscription, because you will get updated copies of books, and save a good sum of money too. Also, because I find switching between a hard to carry textbook and a laptop is pretty tiring for long periods. My recommendations are:

### Deep Learning with Python by _Francois Chollet_
This is a great book that gets you started with Deep Learning. Recommended after you finish introductory Machine Learning courses from Udacity or from ai.google.

###  Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by _Peter Norvig and Steven Russell_
This is one of THE greatest books on AI that exists on the planet. Your perspective of various concepts be redefined once you go through this book. Like the previous one, this is also a must read!

### Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow by _Aurelien Geron_

I liked the simple hands on approach and easy to follow excercises. Although Tensorflow has evolved a lot... still a good book for beginners.

### Data Science from Scratch by _Joel Grus_

Joel Grus's book is one of the best introductory textbooks on Data Science covering an introduction to python programming and also all essential concepts of machine learning and data science. This is a good refresher/reference book of the fundamentals of data science for  intermidate learners as well.

### The Deeplearning Book by _Ian Goodfellow_ [link](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

This is one of the best books on deep learning for beginners as well as experienced engineers. Pair it with Joel Grus' book and you have the bases covered. The link is for the online version of the book.

### Mathematics for Machine Learning by _Marc Peter Deisenroth, A Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong_ [link](https://mml-book.github.io/)

A great book to revise the basics of mathematics and essential math concepts needed for Machine Learning. The link is for the github repo for the book.
