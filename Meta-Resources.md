# Meta-Resources
These are resources not directly linked with Machine Learning and AI, however are very valuable to build up foundational knowledge about mathematics, statistics, algebra, general knowledge about tech etc. After all, Data science is a mixture of a multitude of disciplines, and finishing MOOCs or Kaggle competitions will take us far, because after all, its a skillset (although a very sophisticated one!).

We must have that "sense" or "meta" in us to innovate and come up with ideas, concepts and methods of applying this skillset. A large part of productive data science lies on analysis and identification of problems... then comes the data gathering and model building.

So, here are the list of **extra-curricular** resources which will come in handy!

* [Brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org/) - This is an awesome website for learning through solving puzzles and challenges that solidify the conceps we learn. Check it out.

* [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) - You need to know basic SQL because most of the data, are still in databases, not CSVs which you can load to dataframes in a few seconds.
