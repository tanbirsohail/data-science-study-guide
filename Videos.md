Some of my all time favourite video playlists from youtube are:

### Essence of Linear Algebra Series by 3 Blue 1 Brown [(link)](https://youtu.be/fNk_zzaMoSs)

This course has re-taught me linear algebra. One of the best video series ever. If only maths were taught with such an approach in Schools, the world would be a much better place.

### Neural Networks by 3 Blue 1 Brown [(link)](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk)

Amazing 3 part video introduction to Neural Networks. The elaborate explaination of Backpropagation with visual representation of how algorithms work is surely a treat.

### Essence of Calculus Series by 3 Blue 1 Brown [(link)](https://youtu.be/WUvTyaaNkzM)

Yes. This is the best calculus course you will ever take. I wish maths was taught like this in high school. Seriously, so many concepts will be cleared up by this one course. You have to take this course to believe it!

### Unconventional Neural Networks - sentdex [(link)](https://youtu.be/a7Og0ImTg9Q)

I really love his teaching style. If you have got the hang of neural networks and have got time to spare... then this would be it. You will have lots of takeaways after finishing this series.

### Machine Learning Recipies with Josh Gordon - Google Developers [(link)](https://youtu.be/cKxRvEZd3Mw)

[Josh Gordon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuabendergordon/) is one of the best devs in Google tensorflow team. In this series, aimed at complete beginners, we get aquainted with various machine learning concepts and tools.
