Some of my all time favourite video playlists from youtube are:

### Essence of Linear Algebra Series by 3 Blue 1 Brown

https://youtu.be/fNk_zzaMoSs

This course has re-taught me linear algebra. One of the best video series ever. If only maths were taught with such an approach in Schools...

### Neural Networks by 3 Blue 1 Brown

https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk

Amazing 3 part video introduction to Neural Networks. The elaborate explaination of Backpropagation with visual representation of how algorithms work is surely a treat.

### Essence of Calculus Series by 3 Blue 1 Brown

https://youtu.be/WUvTyaaNkzM

Yes. This is the best calculus course you will ever take. I wish maths was taught like this in high school. Seriously, so many concepts will be cleared up by this one course. You have to take this course to believe it!

### Unconventional Neural Networks - sentdex

I really love his teaching style. If you have got the hang of neural networks and have got time to spare... then this would be it. You will have lots of takeaways after finishing this series.
