# Paid Courses
I sincerely believe learning should be free, and for most of these courses, they have generously provided an audit option for learners. You can get verified certificates for these courses and hence, show off your skills to prospective employers or get that awesome "street-cred" in the AI community. However, I think, all courses should be accompanied by a robust portfolio of Projects showcasing your skills and originality to apply the concepts that you have learned! 

So, some of the Paid Courses that I think are worth the  investment are:
### Deeplearning.ai 5 course specializaton - Professor Andrew NG - Coursera
These courses are great, beginner friendly, and a little theory heavy, compared to Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree.

### Nanodegree - Artificial Intelligence - Peter Norvig, Sebastian Thrun - Udacity
Of all the diffenent nanodegrees, I found this one to be worth its value. There are other Udacity nanodegrees on other topics like Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and foundational courses as well. However this is the best one.

### Coursera - Neural Networks for Machine Learning - Geoffrey Hinton
This course provides a good overview on neural networks and goes into advanced concepts as well. A very good intermediate course after you have finished some foundational courses on deep learning.
