# Paid Courses
I sincerely believe learning should be free, and for most of these courses, they have generously provided an audit option for learners. You can get verified certificates for these courses and hence, show off your skills to prospective employers or get that awesome "street-cred" in the AI community. However, I think, all courses should be accompanied by a robust portfolio of Projects showcasing your skills and originality to apply the concepts that you have learned! 

So, some of the Paid Courses that I think are worth the  investment are:
### Deeplearning.ai 5 course specializaton - Professor Andrew NG - Coursera
These courses are great, beginner friendly, and a little theory heavy, compared to Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree.
