# data-science-study-guide
Data Science Study Resources, materials and useful info found in my learning journey in the field of Data Science.

Getting Started: This study guide will contain all courses related to AI and ML.

I got started following Siraj Raval's 3 Month curriculum in Machine Learning. The repository can be found here :
https://github.com/llSourcell/Learn_Machine_Learning_in_3_Months

Additionally, I have decided to include Books, Journals, Papers, Podcasts and Study Materials as well that I have found to be helpful.

I am eventually looking forward to completing one or two Nanodegrees from Udacity in the upcoming months. More updates on those.

A big thanks to Siraj Raval for his ideas and inspirations. 

# Materials
I have decided to segragate based on sources rather than segregating based on contents.
The following pages will have the required materials courses.

* Free courses
* Paid courses
* Books
* Videos
* Podcasts
* Journals and Papers
