# data-science-study-guide
Data Science Study Resources, materials and useful info found in my learning journey in the field of Data Science.

Getting Started: This study guide will contain all courses related to AI and ML.

I got started following Siraj Raval's 3 Month curriculum in Machine Learning. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/llSourcell/Learn_Machine_Learning_in_3_Months)!


Additionally, I have decided to include Books, Journals, Papers, Podcasts and Study Materials as well that I have found to be helpful.

I am eventually looking forward to completing Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree and fast.ai Deep Learning courses in the upcoming months. I'll post more updates on those as I progress.

A big thanks to Siraj Raval for his ideas and inspirations. 

## Materials
I have decided to segragate based on sources rather than segregating based on contents.
The following pages will have the useful materials and resource links. Once I complete my courses, I will include a full fledged opitimal path that will help in reaching the proficiency to take part in Kaggle competitons and implement Machine Learning Projects.

* Free courses
* Paid courses
* Books
* Videos
* Podcasts
* Journals and Papers
